## What is Brainfuck?

Computer scientists always look to change the world with their creations, but once in a while, there comes an invention with absolutely no use at all. Seriously. 

Brainfuck is one of those creations: an esoteric language created by Urban MÃ¼ller in 1993, it is noted for its extreme minimalist style and only consists of 8 instructions, a data pointer and an instruction pointer.

While it is fully Turing complete, it is not intended for practical use, but to challenge and amuse programmers. Brainfuck simply requires one to break commands into microscopic steps. The language's name is a reference to the slang term brainfuck, which refers to things so complicated or unusual that they exceed the limits of one's understanding.

## What about Earf__k?

Well, Earf_ck is a language (can we even call it a language? LOL) developed to convert Audio into Brainfuck programming language, and vice versa.

We came together and thought: what if we could hear our computer programs? Or even better: what if we could create a program with music?

This was developed purely for fun, but this might have practical applications. Maybe.

## What's the future for Earf__k?

We first thought that we could create a transpiler for other languages such as JS and Python to actual music notes, but that was extremely difficult. Who knows?
