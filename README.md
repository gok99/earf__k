## What's Earfunk?

Earfunk is Brainfuck encoded as audio, transpilable to and from brainfuck.

We came together and thought: what if we could hear our computer programs? Or even better: what if we could create a program with music?

This is (and will probably remain) totally useless.

## TODO

- Be less restrictive with note segment lengths (see goertzel algorithm)
- Allow more expressivity (comment segments, ignore ranges, etc)
- Play with integrating X to bf compilers
